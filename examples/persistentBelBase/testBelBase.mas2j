/* 

This project exemplifies how to customise the belief
base (BB) to persist it.

Agent "a" uses a customised BB provided by Jason
that store its beliefs in a file called "a.bb". 

Agent "b" has a customised BB that does not 
store the beliefs! The source of this customisation
is in this project.
