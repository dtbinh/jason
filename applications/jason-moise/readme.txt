This Jason application exemplifies how to develop agent in an organised
society based on the Moise+ organisational model (http://moise.sf.net).

To run the some applications using JasonIDE, open a project 
    example/writePaper/writePaper.mas2j
or
    example/auction/orgAuction.mas2j

and start it. The chapter 4 of doc/tutorial.pdf explains in details 
the examples.

Note: Jason 1.0.1 is required.
