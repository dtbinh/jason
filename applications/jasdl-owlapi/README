*** Running JASDL ***

Firstly, please check you are using the latest revision of the entire Jason trunk from the SVN before use.

To run a JASDL agent, its class-path must include all jars under the sub-directories: 
	* trunk/applications/jasdl-owlapi/lib
	* trunk/applications/jmca/lib
	* All standard Jason libraries, please ensure that these are built from the latest revision of the Jason trunk.	

The (unmodified) travel_agent example (trunk/applications/jasdl-owlapi/examples/travel_agent/config.mas2j) 
must be run in-situ within the Jason trunk. All necessary ant tasks will be performed by its custom build script.	
			
*** Configuring JASDL ***

Please refer to /trunk/jason/applications/jasdl-owlapi/examples/travel_agent/config.mas2j for an example of how to configure JASDL agents.


Thank you for your interest in JASDL!
